# Individual_Self_Assessment-Deliverable

## Self Assessment

For this project I participated in several ways, one of my main contributions was to make the ML model with the Kmeans to work, it had issues and I managed to improve it so it could deliver its purpose wich was to generate a recommendation of a restaurant to the user based on two criteria, nearest to his/her location but based on the ones that had the most amount of ratings, meaning they were popular. Other role I took was to make presentation for the delivery of part three and final presentation. Finally I palyed an other role wich was to some times lead the team by distributing tasks and suggesting on what we should focus.

Each one of the team members played a very important role through put the proyect and one very important thing that happened is that actually we all worked toghether and helped each ogher in a very friendly manner and searching to allways help to achieve the final goal, to deliver our project.

My bigggest challenge was to be able to manage time between work family and bootcamp, I has only a part of the afternoon and the night to work with the project. Actually the way I resolved was to lead the team to get toghether almos every day for the past month and tryed to get the most of the time we has togheter. Actually I had a seconf challenge that was to be proficcient to actually deliver to and with the team, so for that I put a lot of effort to search and review again canvas so I could try to get close to the level that the rest of the team had, wich by the way was very high.

## Team Assesstmen

Our communication protocol was actually based on having daily working session in wich each one of the memebers of the team brought the things they were able to biuld through out the day, and if some of us didn`t had the change to make progress on the morning we used the session to actually work and support each other. Is important to mention that we always has very respectful conversations and we always managed to tell our mind, make our ponts and always search the middle ground so we could privilege the delivery above anything else, but I have to say that all the time we worked togheter everything worked amazingly and it was easy to work side by side with each one of the team members.

My main tip would be to invest time on actually plan each step of the project, have an MVP and focus first on delivering that and then you can build around it and make it more robust,

## Summary of the Project

Topic: Restaurant recomendator for users. Delivering a 7 points recommendation based on three words given as input from the user with his preferences and then also based on his location, were he recieved nearest reataurants that had the highest level of popularity (highest reviews)
Machine model used: we used 2 Unsupervised Machine Learning Models to solve this  problem: One for the restaurant location and other for the recommendations.First we take the user’s position, ratings and number of reviews  to search the nearest restaurants around him.With that list, we use a NLP matrix to analyze the reviews that  matches the user’s preferences. Finally, we show a map with the best selection. 

The result of the analysis was a fully operational site with the ability to give recommendations as expected.
